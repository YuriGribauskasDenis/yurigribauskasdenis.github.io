## Welcome to My Webpage

I am ...

### Cybernetic

I've got first high education in cybernectics. It is a science about control. Aplied to everything from controlling a ship to managing a nuclear plant. It means I know mathematics. I had multiple courses of calculus, economics, computer science etc.

### Programmer

I encountered a long row of programming languages during my study from school to university. Mainly from C family. Now my weapon of choice is python.

```python
print('Stop trying to be a good human, try to be just human\n' * 21)
```

I was a neural network enthusiast prior to their boom and sadly missed it.

### Deep Learning Engineer

Not to be left in past I've got my second master in modern AI and machine learning. Deep learning mainly.

### Creator

I was in a university where lots of students wanted to learn how to make computer games. I was one of them. And since in our enthusiast groups there was no need in like 30 programmers I became a designer who understood programmers perfectly.

I had lots of 3D and 2D projects in game design, level design, concept art using Photoshop, 3DSMax, Blender. I draw and paint.

I am a photographer.

My apologies. At this moment I could not make multimedia insertions work in styles proposed by GitHub.

### Writer

I wrote history books on second world war. Photo albums for Lee Archer.

I wrote short stories for interteinment and therapy purposes.

### Chemist

I was working in a chemical medicin production laboratory. Made cosmetological precursors. Had zoological medicine experience.

### Language enthusiast

I know three languages: Ukrainian, English, Russian; and semi speak two more: Spanish, German.

### New Grounds

My only currently active project

[NewGrounds](https://newgrounds.online/)

Crypto Collection & Crypto Game based on its own token.

### PS

I am from Ukraine. I saw collapse of empire, uncertain times, witnessed catastrophies. That region teaches you to face instability.

For me it is hard to imagine a human being who knows what he will want to do for the rest of his life and never changes his mind nor will have doubts. From this perspective there is no universal or precise description of character to be used here.

Several times in my life I changed my career direction. Maybe too many times. But the world does not stand in one place. It moves. And that I tried to follow to my fullest. In my humble opinion it is never too late to learn. And only telomere’s length can give one an idea of someone’s age. So, it is never too late...

This treat is especially important for programmers. One never learns profession and uses it till the last breath. One constantly has to dive into something new: module, technology, etc.

And this is what I present to you: an erudite, an enthusiast, a simple man with complicated views and life, an eager man.
